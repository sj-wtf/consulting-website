Cloud Managed Services provide you with the stability of a dedicated IT team, and the flexibility of the cloud to deliver your services with as little hassle as possible.

## Cloud Product Partner

Many businesses are interested in the flexibility of cloud services, however even cloud services require management and support. Managing and securing Office 365 and Google Workspace can take up a lot of your time that you could use building your business. Allow MN Cloud Consulting to manage your Office 365 or Google Workspace configuration for you, and free yourself to focus on what really matters to you and your business.

## Hosting Open Source Tooling

There are many open source[^1] alternatives to costly software, however running this software often requires some careful architecture design, security considerations, and domain-specfic knowledge to maintain. MN Cloud Consulting can provide that expertise and knowledge for you, so you don't have to hire another engineer or put additional strain on your existing engineers. We manage your service in your own cloud accounts, so you don't have to worry about another 3rd party data breech exposing you and your customer's data.

## Hosting for Custom Software

Many companies have developed their own software to do specifically what their business needs, and they run this software themselves, on servers in a computer room, or somewhere around their office. What happens when the office floods, or the power goes out, or someone bumps a power button? You completely lose access to an application that could be vital to operating your business. We can migrate your application from your local servers to the cloud, which mitigates all those scenarios, and provides better availability for your application.

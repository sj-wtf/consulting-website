Knowing exactly what your system is doing is a vital part of running a software system, and knowing when you need to scale up. Having metrics regarding what your system is doing can help you scale your infrastructure to the right size, which usually means a lower cloud bill. Metrics and logs can also help you identify performance bottlenecks, identify bad actors in your system, understand how users are engaging with your system. All of these signals can help you make well-informed business decisions about what's working and what's not, where to focus your developers time and energy to maximize your product's impact, and where your business needs to scale next.

Many companies today use many different cloud services to run their business. Cloud bills are not always clear in their invoices as to where certain costs come from. Sometimes, companies are paying for a new tool, when they've already received a full license to use a competitor's tool that serves the same function. MN Cloud Consulting can dig deep into your cloud service subscriptions, identify problem areas and potential overlapping functionality, and provide a report on where your business could save some money without compromising on quality.
